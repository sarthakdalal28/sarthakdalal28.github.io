👋 Hello! I’m Sarthak Dalal, a Software Engineer at Google. I'm passionate about software engineering and LLMs, and I currently apply this passion to my work on a Gemini-powered chatbot for Google Analytics. My academic background includes a Master of Science in Computer Science from [Rutgers University]((https://www.rutgers.edu/)) and a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Telecommunication from the [University of Mumbai]((https://mu.ac.in/)).

🔍 Before joining Google, I had an impactful internship as a Software Development Intern in Machine Learning at [PipeIQ]((https://pipeiq.live/)). There, I engineered a customer-centric chatbot using Python and LangChain agents, developed a robust Fast API endpoint on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and integrated analytics that led to a 35% increase in actionable insights for the marketing team. At Rutgers, I also served as a Teaching Assistant for "Computer Applications for Business"

🚀 As I advance in my career, I am driven by a passion for innovation and a desire to leverage my technical skills and problem-solving capabilities to drive significant technological advancements. I am always eager to tackle complex challenges and contribute to impactful solutions.
