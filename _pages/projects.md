- Developed a Two-Way Real-Time Sign Language Recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for American Sign Language (ASL) and Indian Sign Language (ISL).
- Used a dataset with 140 images for each sign for both language systems, used skin detection and hand segmentation techniques to isolate the hand region from the background.
- Implemented CNN for classification of signs and achieved an accuracy of over 90% on the test set.

- Developed a Real-Time American Sign Language Recognition model using Yolov5.
- Annotated 40 images for each sign using Roboflow to prepare the training and validation dataset.
- Received a confidence level of above 0.7 on all signs while testing.

- Led a team of 3 in developing a maze-solving application using the A* search algorithm that enables an agent to navigate a 101x101 grid maze with obstacles to reach a target cell using the shortest route, with a Manhattan distance heuristic.
- Implemented and tested backward A* search and adaptive A* search algorithms, comparing their execution times to forward A* search.
- Created an interactive graphical user interface using the pygame module to visually display the shortest path the agent takes to reach the target.

## [BidBazaar](https://github.com/sarthakdalal28/BidBazaar)

*Feb 2023 – Apr 2023*

- An auction website like eBay, with features like user account creation, auctions, browsing and advanced search functionality, and admin and customer representative functions.

## [Battery Management and Data Analytics of Battery and Vehicle Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h5LKCGwVmHiE2JE1-vqnd2KJ_P_MXbcI/view?usp=share_link)

*Sep 2021 – Apr 2022*

- Led a team of 4 in designing a Data Acquisition System and Battery Management System and integrating it into the brain of the vehicle, (Vehicle Control Unit) to create a robust electronics system for an Electrics Vehicle.
- Prepared Machine Learning models such as Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, LASSO Regression to predict the SOC (State of Charge) of the battery of the vehicle. Gradient Boosting achieved the best R2 score of 0.977.

## [Electrokeet](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?app=desktop&list=PLqhmzublQR2dDv7V1wk5Ys_D9UJpwZWI9)

*Sep 2019 - May 2021*

- Our Team's entry to IICDC 2019-2020 competition - Electrokeet is a drone that uses thermal imaging and AI to detect pests at their nascent phases of life.
- Integrated AMG8833 with Arduino UNO to design a thermal camera.
- Used a Texas Instruments board, MSP430F5438 and integrated it to a soil sensor.
- Designed the front end of the market place of the website using HTML, CSS, JS.

## [Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle](https://djsceietesf.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/dj-strike-magazine-final.pdf)

*Sep 2020 - Apr 2021*

- Engineered an unmanned autonomous vehicle to improve the disaster management system of our country, by delivering food and medicines from time to time to the numerous quarantine centers.
- Performed a running simulation of the autonomous robot on Gazebo using ROS. Executed JS framework to design a GUI and assembled a prototype using Raspberry Pi 3B, Rpi Cam, Arduino UNO, HCSR-05 ultrasonic sensor and GPS module.
