Hey there! Welcome to my personal website! My name is Sarthak Dalal and I am current pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/). I received my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Telecommunication from [University of Mumbai](https://mu.ac.in/).

Skills
========
I possess a diverse set of technical skills, including proficiency in web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Flask, and NodeJS. I am experienced in working with databases, particularly SQL and MongoDB. Additionally, I have a strong command of programming languages such as C, C++, R, Java, Python, and JavaScript. In the field of machine learning, I have hands-on experience with popular frameworks and libraries such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Keras, and Pandas.

Looking Ahead
========
As I progress in my academic journey and expand my skill set, I am eagerly seeking full-time roles in software development, machine learning, and data science. Starting from the summer of 2024, I am excited to join a dynamic organization where I can contribute my problem-solving abilities, passion for technology, and collaborative nature to make a meaningful impact.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you and exploring potential opportunities in the near future!
