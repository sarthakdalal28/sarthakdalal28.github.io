👋 Hello! I'm Sarthak Dalal, a Master of Science in Computer Science graduate from [Rutgers University]((https://www.rutgers.edu/)), where I specialized in machine learning, data science, and software development. My academic foundation is deeply rooted in technology, having earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Telecommunications from the [University of Mumbai]((https://mu.ac.in/)).

🔍 At Rutgers, I have immersed myself in a rigorous curriculum including artificial intelligence, data structures, and computer vision, maintaining a stellar GPA of 3.9. My career includes impactful internships such as a Software Development Intern in Machine Learning at PipeIQ, where I designed an advanced customer-centric chatbot, and a Research Intern at the Indian Institute of Technology - Delhi, focusing on AI applications in the judiciary system.

💻 I possess a comprehensive skill set encompassing web technologies like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Flask, and NodeJS, and databases such as SQL and MongoDB. My programming expertise spans C, C++, R, Java, Python, and JavaScript. In machine learning, I'm proficient with TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Keras, and Pandas, applying these tools to both academic projects and real-world applications.

🚀 As I advance in my career, I am keen to explore full-time opportunities in software development, machine learning, and data science. Starting from the summer of 2024, I am eager to join a dynamic team where I can leverage my technical skills, problem-solving capabilities, and passion for innovation to drive significant technological advancements.
